Explanation:
Array of Indexed Values:

We create a indexedNums array where each element is a pair of the form {value, original_index}. This allows us to track the original indices even after sorting the array.

Sorting:

We sort the indexedNums array based on the values (nums[i]). Sorting helps us use the two-pointer technique, which will allow us to efficiently find the pair that adds up to the target.

Two Pointers:

We initialize two pointers: left at the beginning and right at the end of the sorted array.

In each iteration, we check the sum of the elements at the left and right pointers.

If the sum matches the target, we return the indices of those elements in the original array (not the sorted array).

If the sum is smaller than the target, we increment the left pointer to increase the sum.

If the sum is greater than the target, we decrement the right pointer to decrease the sum.

Example Walkthrough:

Example 1:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

Step 1: Create indexedNums as [[2, 0], [7, 1], [11, 2], [15, 3]].

Step 2: Sort indexedNums (it's already sorted).

Step 3: Initialize left = 0 and right = 3.

The sum is 2 + 15 = 17, which is greater than 9, so we move right to 2.

The sum is 2 + 11 = 13, still greater than 9, so move right to 1.

The sum is 2 + 7 = 9, which matches the target! We return the indices [0, 1].

Example 2:
nums = [3, 2, 4]
target = 6
Step 1: Create indexedNums as [[3, 0], [2, 1], [4, 2]].

Step 2: Sort indexedNums to [[2, 1], [3, 0], [4, 2]].

Step 3: Initialize left = 0 and right = 2.

The sum is 2 + 4 = 6, which matches the target! We return the indices [1, 2].

Example 3:
nums = [3, 3]
target = 6
Step 1: Create indexedNums as [[3, 0], [3, 1]].

Step 2: Sort indexedNums (it's already sorted).

Step 3: Initialize left = 0 and right = 1.

The sum is 3 + 3 = 6, which matches the target! We return the indices [0, 1].

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the array. This comes from the sorting step (Arrays.sort()).

Space Complexity: O(n), because we use an auxiliary array (indexedNums) to keep track of the original indices.
