Step-by-Step Approach

Step 1: Initialize result matrix
Create a new matrix res of the same size as the input img.

Step 2: Iterate through each cell
For each cell (i, j) in img, iterate through all 3x3 neighbors around (i, j):
	Valid neighbors are those within bounds 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n.
	Accumulate the sum and count of valid neighbors.

Step 3: Compute average
Set res[i][j] = sum / count using integer division (/), which gives the floor of the average.

Time Complexity: O(m × n) — every cell is visited and at most 9 neighbors are checked.
Space Complexity: O(m × n) — for the result matrix.
