âœ… Problem Summary:
Given an integer array nums, return:
 The third distinct maximum number if it exists.
 Otherwise, return the maximum number.

âœ… Efficient Approach: Track Top 3 Distinct Maxima Manually
ðŸ’¡ Idea:
We donâ€™t sort the entire array.
Instead, we keep track of the top three distinct values using three variables (first, second, third).
Update these values as we iterate.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
