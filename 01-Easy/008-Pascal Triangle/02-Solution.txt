To generate Pascal's Triangle, we need to understand the structure of the triangle itself. Each row in Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the coefficients of binomial expansions. Specifically, the number at position (i, j) in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, which are positioned at (i-1, j-1) and (i-1, j).

Key Observations:
1. The first and last elements of each row are always 1.
2. Any other element in the row can be calculated as the sum of the two elements directly above it.

Approach:
1. Start with an empty list: Begin by initializing a list to store the rows.
2. Generate each row: For each row, generate the elements based on the previous row:
	The first and last elements are always 1.
	Any other element at position j in row i is the sum of triangle[i-1][j-1] and triangle[i-1][j].
3.Return the list after generating all rows.

Explanation:
1. Triangle Initialization: We start with an empty triangle list. Each row is added as a list of integers.
2. Row Construction: For each row (from i = 0 to i = numRows - 1):
	We start by adding 1 as the first element of the row.
	For rows where i > 1, we add the sum of two numbers from the previous row (the element directly above left and the element directly above right).
	Finally, if i > 0, we add 1 as the last element of the row.
3. Return the Triangle: After generating all the rows, we return the list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle.

Time Complexity:
O(numRows^2): We have to generate numRows rows, and each row can have at most numRows elements. So, the overall time complexity is quadratic.

Space Complexity:
O(numRows^2): We are storing numRows rows, and the maximum number of elements in each row is numRows. Hence, the space complexity is quadratic as well.

Example Walkthrough:
Example 1:
Input: numRows = 5
	Row 0: [1]
	Row 1: [1, 1]
	Row 2: [1, 2, 1]
	Row 3: [1, 3, 3, 1]
	Row 4: [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]

The output will be:
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

Example 2:
Input: numRows = 1
	Row 0: [1]

The output will be:
[[1]]
Edge Case:
For the case where numRows = 1, the triangle simply consists of the first row [1].

Output Example:
Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows: [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
Pascal's Triangle with 1 row: [[1]]
This solution efficiently constructs Pascal's Triangle for any value of numRows between 1 and 30 as specified in the problem constraints.
