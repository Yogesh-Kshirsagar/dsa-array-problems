Step-by-Step Approach:
Step 1: Define the Keyboard Rows
	Store each row as a Set of lowercase characters:
	row1 = "qwertyuiop"
	row2 = "asdfghjkl"
	row3 = "zxcvbnm"

Step 2: For Each Word:
	Convert the word to lowercase.
	Determine which row the first letter belongs to.
	Check if all letters of the word are in that same row.

Step 3: Return Words That Match
	Collect and return the words that satisfy the condition.
