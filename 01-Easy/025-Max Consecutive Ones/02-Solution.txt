Problem Understanding:
You're given an array of 0s and 1s. You need to find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive 1s.

Step-by-Step Solution:
Step 1: Initialize Two Variables
maxCount = 0: Keeps track of the maximum number of consecutive 1s found.
currentCount = 0: Tracks the current streak of consecutive 1s.

Step 2: Loop Through the Array
For each element num in nums:
If num == 1, increment currentCount.
If num == 0, reset currentCount to 0.
Update maxCount with Math.max(maxCount, currentCount).

Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space: O(1), uses only two integer variables.
