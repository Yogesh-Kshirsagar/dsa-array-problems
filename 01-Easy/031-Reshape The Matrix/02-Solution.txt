Problem Summary:
Given a matrix mat of size m x n, and two integers r and c, return a new matrix of size r x c containing the elements of mat in row-wise (left to right, top to bottom) order.
If r * c != m * n, the reshape is not possible, so return the original matrix.

Step-by-Step Approach:
Step 1: Check feasibility
If m * n != r * c, return mat as is.

Step 2: Create new matrix
Initialize a new matrix reshaped with size r x c.

Step 3: Traverse and fill
Flatten the original matrix using a nested loop (row-wise).
As you iterate, fill the reshaped matrix using a running index i, mapping it as:
row = i / c
col = i % c
