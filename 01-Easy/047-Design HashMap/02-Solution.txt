Approach: Separate Chaining with Buckets
We will:
	Create a fixed-size array of buckets (e.g. 1000 or a prime number like 769)
	Each bucket holds a list of key-value pairs
	On collision (same hash index), we traverse and update or add as needed

Time and Space Complexity
Operation	Average Case	Worst Case
put	O(1)	O(n) (if all keys hash to same bucket)
get	O(1)	O(n)
remove	O(1)	O(n)
Space	O(N + B)	where N = number of elements, B = buckets
