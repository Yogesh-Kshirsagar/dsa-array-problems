✅ Optimal Approach: Use Hash Sets
🔍 Intuition:
Use a Set to store the elements of the first array.
Iterate over the second array:
  If an element is in the set, it's an intersection → add to result set.
Use a Set for the result to avoid duplicates.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time	O(n + m) — where n and m are lengths of nums1 and nums2
Space	O(n + m) — for the two sets

Follow-Up (if HashSet not allowed):
If you're not allowed to use extra space, you can:
 Sort both arrays → Use two pointers to find intersection
 Time: O(n log n + m log m) due to sorting
 Space: O(1) (ignoring output)
