To solve this problem efficiently, we need to find the element that appears only once in the array, while all other elements appear twice.

Key Insights:
1. XOR Operation:
	The XOR operation (^) has a very useful property:
		a ^ a = 0 (XOR of a number with itself is 0)
		a ^ 0 = a (XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself)
		XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter.

	Given this, if you XOR all the numbers in the array, all the numbers that appear twice will cancel out (because x ^ x = 0), and the only number that appears once will remain.

2. Constant Space:
	We are asked to use constant extra space, meaning we cannot use additional data structures like hashmaps or arrays.
	XOR allows us to solve this problem in a space-efficient way by only keeping track of a single variable.

Approach:
Initialize a variable, say result, to 0.
Traverse through the array and XOR each number with result.
By the end of the loop, the result will contain the element that appears only once, as all elements that appear twice will have canceled out to zero.

Explanation:
Initial Value: result = 0
We start with 0 because XORing any number with 0 leaves the number unchanged.

XOR Operation:
As we loop through the array, we XOR each element with result.
For every pair of equal numbers, their XOR will result in 0 (a ^ a = 0).
The only number that doesn't get canceled out will be the number that appears once.

Final Result:
After processing all the numbers, the result will contain the number that appears only once.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once, and each XOR operation takes constant time.

Space Complexity: O(1), because we only use a single integer variable (result) to store the result, which does not depend on the size of the input.

Example Walkthrough:
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1]
result = 0
First iteration: result = 0 ^ 2 = 2
Second iteration: result = 2 ^ 2 = 0
Third iteration: result = 0 ^ 1 = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
result = 0
First iteration: result = 0 ^ 4 = 4
Second iteration: result = 4 ^ 1 = 5
Third iteration: result = 5 ^ 2 = 7
Fourth iteration: result = 7 ^ 1 = 6
Fifth iteration: result = 6 ^ 2 = 4
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
result = 0
First iteration: result = 0 ^ 1 = 1
Output: 1

Conclusion:
This solution efficiently finds the single number in linear time and constant space, making it an optimal approach to solve this problem.
