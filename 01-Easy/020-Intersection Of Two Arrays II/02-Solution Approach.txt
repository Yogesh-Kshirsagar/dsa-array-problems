Problem Summary:
Given two arrays nums1 and nums2.
Return all common elements, where each element should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
Result order doesn't matter.

âœ… Best Approach: Use a HashMap to Count Frequencies
ðŸ’¡ Intuition:
Use a HashMap to count how many times each number appears in nums1.
Loop through nums2, and if the number exists in the map with a count > 0, add it to the result and decrement the count in the map.

Time & Space Complexity
Time	O(n + m) â€” n = nums1.length, m = nums2.length
Space	O(n) â€” for storing the frequency map of nums1
