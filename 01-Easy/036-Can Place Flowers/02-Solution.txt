Step-by-Step Approach:
Step 1: Understand where a flower can be planted
A flower can be planted at position i if:
	flowerbed[i] == 0 (it's empty),
	and the left neighbor flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 or doesn't exist (i == 0),
	and the right neighbor flowerbed[i + 1] == 0 or doesn't exist (i == flowerbed.length - 1).

Step 2: Iterate through the array
If a flower can be planted at position i, plant it by setting flowerbed[i] = 1 and decrement n.
If at any point n becomes 0, return true early.

Step 3: Final decision
After the loop, if n > 0, return false

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the flowerbed.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we modify the input array in-place.
