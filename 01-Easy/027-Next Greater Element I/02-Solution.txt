Step-by-Step Approach:

Step 1: Use a monotonic decreasing stack
	Traverse nums2 from left to right.
	For each number:
		While the stack is not empty and current number is greater than the top of the stack:
			Pop the top and record in the map that this number’s next greater is the current number.
		Push the current number to the stack.

Step 2: Build a map of next greater elements
	For every element x in nums2, store nextGreaterMap[x] = y, where y is the next greater element of x (or -1 if none exists).

Step 3: Build the result array for nums1
	For each element in nums1, use the map to get the next greater value.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(n + m) — where n = nums2.length and m = nums1.length.
Space: O(n) — for the stack and map.
