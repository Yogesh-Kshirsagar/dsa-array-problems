âœ… Optimal Approach: Sum Formula

Intuition:
The sum of the first n natural numbers (from 0 to n) is:
total = n * (n + 1) / 2
If you subtract the sum of the given array from total, the result will be the missing number.

Time & Space Complexity:
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)

Example:
For nums = [3, 0, 1]:
n = 3

expectedSum = 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6
actualSum = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4
missing = 6 - 4 = 2
