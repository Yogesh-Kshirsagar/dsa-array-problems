Problem Recap:
You are given:
A matrix of size m x n, initially filled with 0s.
A list of operations ops, where each operation ops[i] = [a, b] means:
	Add 1 to all elements in the submatrix from (0, 0) to (a-1, b-1).
You need to find the count of elements in the matrix that have the maximum value after all operations are applied.

Step-by-Step Approach:
Step 1: Understand what each operation does
Each operation [a, b] increases all elements in the top-left a x b submatrix by 1.
So, multiple operations will cause overlapping increments in parts of the matrix.

Step 2: Recognize where the maximum values are
After all operations:
	Some cells will be incremented many times (those inside all operations' overlap).
	Some will be incremented fewer times (those outside some operations).

The maximum value in the matrix will be at the cells that were included in every operation — i.e., the overlapping region of all [a, b].

Step 3: Find the overlapping region
To find the area that is common to all operations:
	Track the smallest value of a among all operations → call this minRow
	Track the smallest value of b among all operations → call this minCol

Because only the minRow x minCol region is guaranteed to be affected by every operation.

Step 4: Calculate result
The number of cells with the maximum value is:
	result = minRow * minCol
Why? Because this is the number of cells that got incremented by every operation.

Step 5: Handle edge case
If ops is empty, then no increments are done.
	All cells remain 0, which is still the maximum value.
	So, return m * n (the entire matrix is the result).

Final Formula:
if ops is empty:
    return m * n
else:
    minRow = minimum of all ops[i][0]
    minCol = minimum of all ops[i][1]
    return minRow * minCol

Example Walkthrough:
Input:
m = 3, n = 3
ops = [[2, 2], [3, 3]]

Matrix is initially:
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

First operation [2, 2]: increment top-left 2x2 area:
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0

Second operation [3, 3]: increment entire 3x3 matrix:
2 2 1
2 2 1
1 1 1

Max value is 2, found in top-left 2x2 area.

Result = 2 x 2 = 4
