Problem Summary
Find the smallest character in letters that is strictly greater than target.
If no such character exists, return the first character in the array (wrap-around).

Approach (Binary Search)
Use binary search to find the first character > target.
If all characters are ≤ target, wrap around and return letters[0].

How the Code Works
If the middle character is less than or equal to target, move low up.
Otherwise, move high down to search left side.
low ends up at the first index where letters[low] > target, or goes beyond array length.
Use low % letters.length to wrap around if needed.

Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(log n) — Binary search.
Space: O(1) — Constant space.
