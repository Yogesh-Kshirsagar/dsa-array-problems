Problem Summary:
Teemo attacks at specific times (timeSeries[i]).
Each attack poisons Ashe for exactly duration seconds: [t, t + duration - 1].
If a new attack happens before the previous poison expires, it resets the poison timer — overlapping time is not double-counted.

Step-by-Step Solution:
Step 1: Initialize Total Poisoned Time
Create a variable totalPoisonedTime = 0.

Step 2: Loop Through All Attacks
Iterate from the first attack to the second last one:
Let current = timeSeries[i] and next = timeSeries[i + 1]

If the next attack starts after the current poison ends:
➤ Add full duration to total.

Else (they overlap):
➤ Only add next - current to total (since that’s the non-overlapping portion).

Step 3: Add Duration for Last Attack
After the loop, add duration for the last attack (since it wasn’t handled inside the loop).
