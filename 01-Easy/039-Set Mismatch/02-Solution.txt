Problem Understanding
You are given an array nums of length n, which should contain all integers from 1 to n. However:
	One number is duplicated (appears twice),
	One number is missing (doesn't appear at all).

Step-by-Step Approach
Step 1: Count Frequency
Use a simple int[] of size n+1 to count the frequency of each number.
Traverse the array and track:
	The number that occurs twice (frequency = 2),
	The number that is missing (frequency = 0).

Time Complexity: O(n) – One pass to count, one pass to find the result.
Space Complexity: O(n) – For the counting array.
