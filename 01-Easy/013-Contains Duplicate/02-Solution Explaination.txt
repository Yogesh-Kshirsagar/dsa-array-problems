HashSet lets you check existence and insert in constant time.

As soon as we find a number thatâ€™s already in the set, we return true.

Much faster than sorting (O(n log n)), especially for large n.

If you're targeting competitive programming or DSA interviews, this approach is totally acceptable and encouraged unless space is very limited.
