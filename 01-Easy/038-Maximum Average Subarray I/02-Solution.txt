Step-by-Step Approach:

Step 1: Sliding Window Concept
Instead of recalculating the sum of each subarray from scratch (which would be O(n*k)), we use a sliding window of size k:
Start by calculating the sum of the first k elements.
Then slide the window one element at a time:
	Subtract the element that is leaving the window.
	Add the new element entering the window.
Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

Step 2: Compute Average
Since we're interested in the average, simply divide the maximum sum by k at the end.

Time Complexity: O(n) – We scan the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) – Constant extra space.
