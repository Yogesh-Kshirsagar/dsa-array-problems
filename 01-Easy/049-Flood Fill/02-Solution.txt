Key Idea (DFS)
Start from the pixel (sr, sc).
Get the original color at that position.
If the original color is the same as the new color, return the image (nothing to change).
Use DFS to recursively update all 4-directionally connected pixels that have the same original color.

Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(m * n) — In worst case, every pixel is visited.
Space Complexity: O(m * n) — Due to recursive call stack in DFS.
