âœ… Optimal Solution â€” In-Place Marking (No Extra Space)
ðŸ’¡ Idea:
Since nums[i] is always between 1 and n, you can use the indices of the array to mark visited numbers by making the number at that index negative.

Iterate through the array:
 For each number num, compute index = abs(num) - 1
 Mark nums[index] as negative to indicate that the number index + 1 has been seen
 In a second pass, any index i where nums[i] > 0 means i + 1 was not seen

Time and Space Complexity:
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1) extra (excluding result list)

Example Breakdown:
Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 After marking: â†’ [-4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
 Unmarked (positive) indices: 4 and 5 (0-based)
 So missing numbers: 5, 6
