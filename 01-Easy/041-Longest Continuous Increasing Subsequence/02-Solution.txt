Problem Summary:
Given an array nums, find the length of the longest subarray where each number is strictly greater than the previous one.

Step-by-Step Approach:
Initialize two variables:
	maxLength to keep track of the overall longest length found.
	currentLength to track the current increasing sequence length.
Iterate through the array from index 1 to the end:
	If nums[i] > nums[i - 1], increment currentLength.
	Else, reset currentLength to 1 (since sequence breaks).
	Update maxLength with the maximum of itself and currentLength.
Return maxLength.

Time Complexity: O(n) — where n is the length of the array.
Space Complexity: O(1) — constant extra space used.
