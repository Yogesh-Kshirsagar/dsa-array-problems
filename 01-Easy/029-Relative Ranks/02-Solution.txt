Problem Breakdown:
Input:
An array score of size n, where score[i] represents the score of the i-th athlete.
The athletes are ranked based on their score in descending order.

Ranking Logic:
The 1st place athlete (highest score) gets "Gold Medal".
The 2nd place athlete gets "Silver Medal".
The 3rd place athlete gets "Bronze Medal".
For the 4th place onward, the athlete's rank is simply their position in the ordered list, i.e., "4", "5", etc.

Objective:
Return an array answer where answer[i] represents the rank of the i-th athlete in the original input array.

Solution Approach:
Sort the scores in descending order to determine the ranking.
Map the sorted scores to their respective ranks.
Generate the result array by using the original positions in the score array and returning the corresponding rank.

Detailed Plan:
Create a list of pairs: Pair each score with its index, so we can retrieve the rank based on the original order.
Sort this list by scores in descending order.
Assign ranks: For the first three athletes, assign "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", and "Bronze Medal". For subsequent athletes, assign the rank based on their position.
Build the result: For each athlete in the original array, assign the rank corresponding to their score.
