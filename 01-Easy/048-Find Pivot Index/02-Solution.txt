Approach (Prefix Sum Trick)
First, calculate the total sum of the array.
Initialize a variable leftSum = 0.
Iterate through the array:
	At each index i, the right sum would be totalSum - leftSum - nums[i].
	If leftSum == right sum, return i as the pivot index.
	Otherwise, add nums[i] to leftSum.
If no pivot index is found, return -1.

Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(n) — One pass to get totalSum, another to find pivot.
Space: O(1) — Only uses a few variables.
