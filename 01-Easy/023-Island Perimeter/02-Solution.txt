✅ Problem Understanding:
Each land cell (1) contributes 4 sides initially.
If it shares a side with another land cell, subtract 1 for each shared side.
You only check right and down neighbors to avoid double-counting shared sides.

✅ Step-by-Step Approach:
Step 1: Initialize perimeter to 0
Step 2: Loop through each cell in the grid
For every cell (i, j):

If it's land (grid[i][j] == 1), add 4 to the perimeter.
Then check its bottom neighbor (i+1, j):
If it is also land, subtract 2 from perimeter (shared edge).
Then check its right neighbor (i, j+1):
If it is also land, subtract 2 from perimeter (shared edge).

Note: Subtract 2 because each shared side affects two land cells.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(rows × cols) — visit each cell once.
Space: O(1) — only a few variables used, no extra data structures.
