To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from buying and selling a stock on different days. 
We are given the stock prices for each day, and we must buy at one day (before the sell day) and sell at a future day to maximize the profit.

Key Insights:
1. Buy Low, Sell High: The goal is to buy at the lowest price before a certain day and sell at a higher price later. The maximum profit will be the difference between the buy price and the sell price, where the sell day comes after the buy day.
2. One Pass Solution: We don't need to examine every possible pair of days (which would result in an O(nÂ²) solution). Instead, we can solve the problem in a single pass through the array by maintaining:
	Min Price: The minimum price encountered so far.
	Max Profit: The maximum profit that can be obtained by selling at the current price after buying at the minimum price so far.

Approach:
1. Iterate through the prices: We will track the minimum price seen so far, and for each price, we calculate the potential profit if we sold at that price (i.e., the current price minus the minimum price so far).
2. Update the max profit: For each price, we calculate the profit if we sold at that price and update the maximum profit if the calculated profit is greater than the current maximum.
3. Return the maximum profit: After iterating through all the prices, we return the maximum profit.

If no profit can be made (i.e., the prices are always decreasing), the result will be 0.

Explanation:
minPrice: We initialize minPrice to Integer.MAX_VALUE to ensure that any price in the array will be less than this initial value at the start. This keeps track of the lowest price encountered so far as we iterate through the array.
maxProfit: We initialize maxProfit to 0 because if no profit can be made, the result should be 0.

Iterating through prices:
For each price, we check if it is lower than minPrice. If it is, we update minPrice.
We then calculate the profit if we sold at the current price, which is price - minPrice.
If this profit is greater than the current maxProfit, we update maxProfit.
Return maxProfit: After the loop finishes, we return the maximum profit we found.

Time Complexity:
O(n): We go through the list of prices once, where n is the length of the array. This makes the solution efficient and optimal.

Space Complexity:
O(1): We only use a constant amount of space (for minPrice and maxProfit), so the space complexity is constant.

Example Walkthrough:
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

Day 1: Price is 7. minPrice = 7, maxProfit = 0.
Day 2: Price is 1. minPrice = 1, maxProfit = 0.
Day 3: Price is 5. Profit = 5 - 1 = 4. maxProfit = 4.
Day 4: Price is 3. Profit = 3 - 1 = 2. maxProfit = 4.
Day 5: Price is 6. Profit = 6 - 1 = 5. maxProfit = 5.
Day 6: Price is 4. Profit = 4 - 1 = 3. maxProfit = 5.

The maximum profit is 5.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]

Day 1: Price is 7. minPrice = 7, maxProfit = 0.
Day 2: Price is 6. minPrice = 6, maxProfit = 0.
Day 3: Price is 4. minPrice = 4, maxProfit = 0.
Day 4: Price is 3. minPrice = 3, maxProfit = 0.
Day 5: Price is 1. minPrice = 1, maxProfit = 0.

Since the prices are always decreasing, no profit can be made, so the result is 0.

Output:
Max Profit for prices1: 5
Max Profit for prices2: 0
This solution efficiently computes the maximum profit in a single pass through the array, which is optimal for large input sizes (up to 100,000 prices).
